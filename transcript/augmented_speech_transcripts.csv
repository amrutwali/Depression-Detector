cultures food music rituals uh everything smells colors makes you feel alive excuse me one my trips uh i lived kenya year um i would say i love horseback riding you uh viewing animals you kind disguised scent horse you approach animals lot closer um it great seeing red orange fall sunsets riding along you know uh seeing many animals yeah kenya um probably i went masai village i happened i used live hawaii i tahiti i wearing one pareos hand painted i it tied left shoulder twisted knot i happened enter masai village first time uh day i looked around men wearing their clothing exactly twist shoulder they came me they said you dressed masai uh um they came back gave me appeared uh large looked like beaded leather bookmarks they actually earrings they would like weighed my ears straight um they gave me bracelets they uh me wear something around my waist they said you look proper masai i i yeah i i lot uh i think living getting chance live different countries around world i uh you feel alive your senses completely you know uh awoken yeah i think it clear cut i think lot peoples hybrid i mean i think i extremely shy sometimes extremely brazen uh courageous times probably one my best virtues i gutsy person i really feel passionate something i risk everything go achieve it sometimes um i believe um usually i well i make decisions quickly i find i friend makes decisions slowly he said me tell me i make decisions quicker i told him i said well case you always choice he says you mean hundreds choices i said really it gut wise one it really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting it gut wise you always know choice you really want it matter whether ninety eight percent chance failure even it two percent chance success you go one may yield you joy i always go it it me waste total time energy even think another choice cares you remain unscathed it it yields joy uh pardon you said you put your fish i i annoyed um i think i annoyed sometimes i it sometimes i i need little patient um i guess you really put yourself somebody elses shoes rather way you would react you empathy um really i think reason i enjoy traveling much you put situations you forced um understand peoples lives lot regardless different they uh yours different situations i many third world countries lived many different situations you it it helps create travel really best education let me think um uh last time i argued something um god i trying remember um oh i think it somebody respect actually my privacy something um uh oh i know it um it somebody belonged uh uh scientology faith um i uh inherited i inherited um possibly uh immune disorder my mother my mother died lupus um uh i sometimes even right i like skin rashes welts everything i photo sensitive um i you know episode i i big flare i really feeling well i felt flushed everything scientologist tells me i needed audited um he said something you aware past lives i told him i buddhist i kind curious you going try recruit somebody convert your religion least you find person religion they even informed able talk them i he said you aware um something your past i go yes i believe many religions uh including buddhisms scientology believe things you your history sometimes affect you things you keep anger issues bitterness um resulting even your past relationships your parents affect make you even sick make you even cancer yes we believe also we also believe i said you know you power person god like buddha like nature go ahead you make yourself even i verge possibly i probably get one cold maybe every fifteen years i tendency sick large part it i think i think i verge i take sort like i even i child uh i seven i would fold i my boo boo i would take i would say i would good part you know help bad part simplistic way terms child i would actually even i severe car accident i got cut glass my whole back i concentrated healing i went back hospital doctors actually nurses come say incredible her last week her back severely cut incredible healing thing i believe uh um uh i i think annoyed irritated little scientologist told me he taken twenty forty courses he certificates his wall he felt he enlightened it it even matter i said whether he um whether he took twenty forty courses whether i would practicing buddhism whether it five ten fifteen twenty years whether somebodyd practicing type christianity fifty years bending sitting church pew every day it mean person could never attended church spiritual somebody you know i thinking antithesis somebody says they enlightened it way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith my throat i pretty patient him he it pompous i became irritated especially he kept telling me it audited yet person needed hip surgery uh following week i point it him i want get it one could say hey you bad hip you need audited something you your past otherwise you would need get hip surgery i mean i believe extent things caused people themselves he flippantly said well you aware scientologists believe past lives also affect you know i thinking myself buddhists religions kind like well known you know believing effect past lives situations i found my thought he really read he trying convert people religions um you know i i you know i i you know care fact he would drop it i mean i um uh sometimes little tact i guess it terms patience i think right away i guess uh disconnecting my father he like vegetable hospital mm mm my brother uh supposed strong one supposedly he medical field my sister i said well you know he medical one he probably used seeing time it turns he weakest one even you know my boss my father kept you know um um you know bucking his body would actually fighting artificial respirator kinds things you see jerking body movements stuff it hard mm you know it uh you know even physicians even uh pastor particular uh hospital you know hospital they said he longer like even he awaken he his brain function would you know negligible yeah it mhm hm mm i think i really many things traumatic happened me i block them i really know it within my makeup make me feel like i need like i keep i friends unmitigated issues they even aware affect their behavior maybe their bitterness their anger their hatred their fear reason i i feel blessed i really i cannot really even think something i mean i bad situations happen me it reason they traumatized me affecting you know my behavior i would i block it i aware something i hold residual negativity reason i really cannot think anything i mean bad things happen i know they it like i feel like i it necessary me block them i able you know um accept sometimes sometimes unfortunate things happened pretty easy i usually make my sleep i self sleep situation i one hour flight san francisco i could kind lean window pillow blanket even hour flight pass plane even taken ground i i literally i little sleep i uh high energy i really need much sleep say like i africa i bumpy potholed unpaved road i suddenly saw i need moments sleep i prop something put my elbow window say i think i going take nap fifteen
